<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">ANNOUNMENT:</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; color: #999;">by Shef Kerbi</span><br><br>
We recenly employed a new employee, Austin, into the news gang so that we could get more news and push out news reports quicker. Unfortunately, we've come to determine that the quality of his articles may not be on par with the expectations of the Shef Kerbi News Network. Since we still believe that Austin should receive at least some chance to see how the public will react, we've published a <a href="24b.html">separate article containing just Austin's articles.</a>

<br><br>
<a href="https://shefwerld.github.io/clothingstore/index.html">Shef Kerbi's Apparel: Collection 2</a> released on the 22<sup>nd</sup> June to a ton of success. We provided a bunch of new merchandise, along with introducting game controllers for the Xbox One, PS4 and Nintendo Switch after the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/319852262/">Shef Kerbi Direct</a>, which was released on the 7<sup>th</sup> of July.<br><br>
From now until the 17<sup>th</sup> of June, everything on the store is 25% off, so now is the perfect time to get some good deals before we close shop temporarily ready for Collection 3!

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Global Warming & Its Effects On The World</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic; color: #999;">by Apple the Cat</span><br><br>
The effects of climate change are being felt all around the world. "Global warming is out of control", a professor at Dreem Lend University says. "It's hard to teach geography when my globe is literally on fire." Additionally, there has been a worrying change in weather patterns, which scientists attribute to the greenhouse effect. We had an interview with one anonymous resident of Flat Land to better understand these problems.<br><br>
</p>
<div id="interv">Apple: Hey, can I interview you? We need to do an interview to make this seem like a complex problem with multiple sides.<br>
Guy: Okay.<br>
A: So, how has the greenhouse effect affected your life?<br>
G: One day I woke up and my house and car were covered in green paint.<br>
A: Wow, sounds cool.<br>
G: No, my car's wheels were stuck to the ground.<br>
A: So, uh, would this green paint, uh, totally theoretically, uh, you know, cover any stains on the exterior of your house?<br>
G: I- uh, what?<br>
A: Like, uh, specifically, what about dried poop stains? One that says, like, in all capitals, uh, "COPYCAT"?<br>
G: ...<br>
A: Ahem, where did this green paint come from?<br>
G: ...The sky.<br>
A: From the sky?<br>
G: Yeah, the sky.<br>
A: Do you have the sky's number?<br>
G: What?<br>
A: Uh, we're running low on time here, anything you want to finish with?<br>
G: Mom! Look! I'm on TV!<br>
A: Okay, I'm Apple the Cat, and that's all from this sknn interview.</div>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">So we told you Shef Kerbi News Network fans on our Scratch page that you could post anything with the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #6565ff;">#SKNN</span> hashtag and you could end up in our paper! In this episode, we'll respond to some of your feedback with the new SKNN format, as well as show some of your cool stuff!</span><br><br>

Wow good thing you listed all the potential pronouns otherwise you could've gotten cancelled on social media.<br>
Anyway, we pay our employees for Shef Kerbi's Apparel the same way that they are paid on Shef Kerbi News Network: Yes I do pay (i promise). The Shef Chop is an execption because we don't trust the Scratch economy to be stable because of all the kids in that country.<br><br>

Read our article <span style="font-weight: bold;">Global Warming & Its Effects On The World</span> (hopefully you already have so the advertisers know you read the entire article so they'll give us more money and more ads) on it. I heard that Apple knew exactly what happened.<br><br>

Recently, the hurricane named DisneyLand picked up the entire country of canada and threw it away. <br>
It has been discovered that canada is now on the moon.<br>
Construction workers have begun working on getting canada back to it(')s original location.<br><br>

Someone saw a piece of rock flying through space recently, which my very reliable source Mr. Nathan U. T. Job claims will result in the end of the world. I asked him about this and when the world is actually ending, and he said roughly one googol years. (I would've thought it'd be one bing years, but I guess not.) You all might want to watch out for that.<br><br>
In other news, I guess a hurricane destroyed Canada / threw Canada to the moon, but thankfully I don't think North America is on Popp Stah so we don't really need to worry about that.<br><br>
