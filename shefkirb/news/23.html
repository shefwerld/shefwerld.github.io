Keyn DDDD has been re-elected as the ruler of Dreem Lend, because apparently that's an elected position. Two major contributors to his success seem to be the fact that he has "Keyn" in his name which is pretty close to "King", and the fact that he was the only candidate running.

The recent language trend (you know, the w***y one) has recently been banned in Dreem Lend. This disappoints everyone who was part of the trend, but people who thought it was annoying are currently partying.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">braken nswe updaet:</span><br>
We have learned that the participators of the w***y trend have been replacing letters with numbers to get around the ban. Keyn DDDD has yet to comment on the matter.<br><br>

News reporter and/or weatherman Zeke Teddy has accidentally travelled a few hours into the future. He's sent back a copy of himself so he can still make news reports, but he's a little confused as to how he managed to accidentally travel through time.

Apple has gone missing, so there's no Candy Sadness anymore, which has made everyone sad. There was also no comics on the news queue, and an SKNN news issue would not be an SKNN news issue without a comic so here's a random comic from Issue 14:<br>

Ok so it's getting a little colder here, top of 19° and bottom of 8°, expect some light rain (very, very light rain)<br>
Tommorow it's a top of 18° and a min 10°, along with a few water molecules condensing and falling but so unnoticeably that you really can't consider it rain, more of... a bracing dampness in the air<br><br>
